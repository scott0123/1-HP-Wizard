# 1-HP-Wizard

## Introduction
1 HP Wizard is a multi-level, gesture-based, spellcasting game. In this game, the user stands in a stationary location and fends off waves of enemies homing in on their position. 

The player will have to react quickly and strategically since it only takes one hit to defeat them.
